The .txt files contain yields
for bb (bb_*) , sn1a (sn1a_*) 
as well as the NuGrid yield tables
isotope_yield_table.txt in solar masses.

The SN1a abundances of Seitenzahl13 are either
provided divided in stable and unstable ones
or in a mix of both types.

The iniabu dir contains
the initial abundances the
the five metallicities provided
by NuGrid.
