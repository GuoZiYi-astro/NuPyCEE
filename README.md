Public NuGrid Python Chemical Evolution Environment

This is a code repository containing the simple stellar population code SYGMA (Stellar Yields for Galactic Modeling Applications), the single-zone galaxy code OMEGA (One-zone Model for the Evolution of Galaxies), and the observational data plotting tool STELLAB (Stellar Abundances).

**Online usage**: These tools can be used directly online via the public WENDI interface (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...513..156M">http://www.nugridstars.org/projects/wendi</a>).

**Userguides**: All of our codes have userguides that are available on WENDI (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...513..156M">http://www.nugridstars.org/projects/wendi</a>).

**Acknowledgments**: The three codes are currently considered as unpublished material. Please look regularly in the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md file, as we will update the proper references that should be made when using NuGrid chemical evolution tools.
